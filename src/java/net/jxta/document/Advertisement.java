/**
 *  Advertisements are core JXTA objects that are used to advertise Peers,
 *  PeerGroups, Services, Pipes or other JXTA resources. Advertisements provide
 *  a platform independent representation of core platform objects that can be
 *  exchanged between different platform implementations (Java, C, etc.).
 *
 *  <p>Each Advertisement holds a document that represents the advertisement.
 *  Advertisements are typically represented as a text document (XML). The
 *  {@link Advertisement#getDocument( MimeMediaType ) getDocument(mimetype)}
 *  method is used to generate representations of the advertisement. Different
 *  representations are available via mime type selection. Typical mime types
 *  are "text/xml" or "text/plain" that generate textual representations for the
 *  Advertisements.
 *
 *  <p>Advertisements are created via {@link AdvertisementFactory}. This is done
 *  because public Advertisement sub-classes are normally abstract with private
 *  sub-classes unique to the implementation.
