    The Access Service provides a framework for using the identities created
    with the Membership Service to control whether specific operations are
    permitted. 

    <p/>The Access Service, like the Membership Service, is not associated with 
    a particular JXTA protocol. Each Access Service implementation is responsible 
    for its own protocol definition (if any). This approach is used primarily
    so that JXTA bridges well to existing common Membership and Access 
    technologies. For example; PKI, Kerberos, NTLM and API based interfaces such
    as PAM and JAAS.
